1. Give an introduction about your topic. (≈ 1/2 − 1 page)
(a) What is the context or background? (b) What is the research question?
(c) What is your approach to answer this question (broadly)?
(d) Procure four academic or other (blog/newspaper/etc.) references around this topic.


2. Describe your data collection strategy. (≈ 1 − 1.5 page)
(a) What is the data source that you will use? What is the actual purpose of this data (i.e.
platform for searching services xy)?
(b) How do you get access? Will you scrape the data, or will you use an application- programming interface? Which Python packages do you plan to use?
(c) Did you already face restrictions like Captchas or other forms of blocking? Have you verified other means to access the data?
(d) What is one observation in your data (e.g. a price quote, a review, an appointment)? What are the different dimensions of the data (car model, doctor, city, time, versions, etc.)? Are the dimensions the same across all the data you collect?
(e) Which is the information you will extract? What is the list of variables that you will have in the columns of a table you use for the analysis? Please provide a screenshot where this becomes more apparent.
(f) What is your strategy to create the sample and in order to increase the number obser- vations? How and by what do you filter the data (e.g. some category, a set of cities, etc.)?
(g) How many observations do you expect to collect in the end?


3. Describe your first ideas for a possible outline for the analysis (≈ 1/2 − 1 page).
(a) Do you expect any steps to pre-process the data that might be time-consuming?
(b) What kind of tables would you produce?
(c) What kind of visualization could be insightful?
(d) For which purpose could you use regression techniques?
(e) Finally, describe a possible outcome of your study, or a type of outcome, and why you think it is interesting.
